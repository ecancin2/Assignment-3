				<h3>Current Pet Owners<br></h3>
				
				<p><strong>
					If you currently own a pet, you may want to be informed on the type of breed your pet is. By scanning
					your pet and getting information on your breed, you can find out the right type of dog food for them 
					that are recommended by veternarians for puppies/kittens or adults. In addition, you can find how 
					much they should eat depending on their age, how much should they be walked if they're dog, how long 
					they should be indoor or outdoor if they're a cat, and what type of vaccinations each breed should get.

					and would show you the correct breed based on their facial features. There would be a database storing info for
					every cat and dog breed possible, guaranteeing the right breed for your pet.
